In this app I created a personal portfolio for myself to display my progress in the MERN stack as well as to show the many projects I have been learning on my path. Using Express I created an API to make the portfolio dynamic and utilized MongoDB to store data that could be accessed and altered through an admin panel with unique user logins. Redux toolkit was also used for proper state management and created multiple schemas and models for a dynamic project. I utilized MERN, Tailwind, and Antd.
